# what happened here?

Sequence was a planned premium but also open source anticheat by SalersFR. When I called out a bunch of skidded code/checks, instead of handling it responsibly, developement was rather suddenly stopped with the ownership handed over to me (?). Due to this, I'm going to archive this. A lot of code belongs to GladUrBad (Medusa) and Tecnio (Hades) it seems like. There is no permission to use this unless you're one of the original "developer" (SalersFR).

Note: I originally listed Orress as a creator here. This was a mistake, I was uninformed. Orress is completely unaffiliated with Salers and Salers' projects. Sorry about that.
